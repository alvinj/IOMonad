IO Monad
========

The source code in this project is for the IO Monad
lessons in my book, [Learning Functional Programming in
Scala](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/fp-book/learning-functional-programming-in-scala).
This source code is discussed in the following lessons:

- How to Use an `IO` Monad
- Assigning a `for` Expression to a Function
- The `IO` Monad and a `for` Expression That Uses Recursion
